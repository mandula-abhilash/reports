Use Express.js for creating a backend API, ensuring it integrates seamlessly with the Next.js frontend.

Follow RESTful API principles for route structuring and clear endpoint purposes.

Use JavaScript for backend developmentâ€”no TypeScript unless explicitly requested.

Implement dotenv for environment variable management and store sensitive credentials securely.

For database interactions, use a modular approach (e.g., models for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, or any preferred database).

Apply middleware for error handling, request validation, and security (e.g., express-validator for validations, helmet for security).

Log server activities effectively using winston or morgan for better debugging and production monitoring.

Ensure the backend is compatible with your chosen frontend libraries (e.g., lucide-react, Tailwind).

Provide secure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) to enable frontend-backend communication.

Add comments and maintain clear documentation for all endpoints and middleware.

Avoid unnecessary dependencies; install new packages only when critical for functionality.
